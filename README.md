# Lumbini City College Schedule System

This is a class scheduling system developed for **Lumbini City College**, designed to automate the scheduling of classes, time slots, teachers, and subjects efficiently.

##  Project Idea & Inspiration

This project was inspired by the challenges faced in managing class schedules at **Lumbini City College**, where manual scheduling often led to conflicts in teacher availability and time slot overlaps.

As a student/developer at the college, I observed how time-consuming and error-prone the process was. This motivated me to build an automated scheduling system that:

- Reduces manual work
- Prevents teacher or subject conflicts
- Makes scheduling more efficient and transparent
